# Hey, This is Md. Rezuwan Hassan and welcome to my GitHub!

---

<h3>I'm a passionate, hardworking, and skilled Machine Learning Engineer.</h3>


I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from BRAC University and M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering majoring in Artificial Intelligence from the same institution. <br>
I'm passionate about AI and eager to make meaningful contributions to all the domains of the field through my efforts. <br>
Growing up, I was always fascinated with language, especially my mother tongue Bengali. 

I have always found it to be really intriguing and yet so beautiful. Both structurakly and to hear in my ears. 

which mostly influenced me to pick Natural Language Processing (NLP) as my working domain. Apart from NLP, I also have interest in Computational Cognitive Science, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision, Federated Learning, Meta-Learning, and Reinforcement learning.
<br>
<br>
In my leisure, I pursue my hobbies. I am really into music and I play the Bass guitar, I also love to take photographs, I also love sketching, writing, reading books and watching movies.
