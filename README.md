# Hey, This is Md. Rezuwan Hassan and welcome to my GitHub!

<h3>I'm a passionate, hardworking, and skilled Machine Learning Engineer.</h3>


I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from BRAC University and M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering majoring in Artificial Intelligence from the same institution. <br>
I'm passionate about AI and eager to make meaningful contributions to all the domains of the field through my efforts. <br>
Growing up, I was always fascinated with language, especially my mother tongue Bengali which mostly influenced me to pick Natural Language Processing (NLP) as my working domain. Apart from NLP, I also have interest in Computational Cognitive Science, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Vision, Federated Learning, Meta-Learning, and Reinforcement learning.
<br>
<br>
In my leisure, I pursue my hobbies and I have multiple hobbies. I am really into music and I play Bass guitar, I love to take photographs, I also love sketching, writing, reading books and watching movies.
